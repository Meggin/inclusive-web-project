# Inclusive Web Project Journal - First 10 Days

## Day 1 - Wednesday, May 9, 2018

Today is the first day of my 100-day challenge to think about how to build a more inclusive web. At the moment, I'm sitting on a shuttle bus heading down to Mountain View for the second day of Google IO 2018.

My primary feeling this morning, is one I'm quite familiar with -- that push and pull between the work that I love doing, and the family that I'm responsible for.

I didn't book a hotel for Google IO, so I'm making the commute back and forth each day, and it is killing me, not being with my team at all times. Just wanted to share that in this journal, in case there are other parents out there, feeling this same way.
