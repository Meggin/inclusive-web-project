# Inclusive Web Project Journal - First 10 Days

Just as a quick FYI-- my plan is to organize journal by 10-day periods, followed by a focused analysis of what I've learned (and pushing forward on action items). Then I'll start the next 10 days. Hopefully this is as good as any way to start this process. My plan is to publish a blog post after each 10 day period. That way I can re-highlight the project, show progress, or lack there-of, and hopefully start to gain some momentum.

## Day 1 - Wednesday, May 9, 2018

Today is the first day of my 100-day challenge to think about how to build a more inclusive web. At the moment, I'm sitting on a shuttle bus heading down to Mountain View for the second day of Google IO 2018.

My primary feeling this morning, is one I'm quite familiar with -- that push and pull between the work that I love doing, and the family that I'm responsible for.

I didn't book a hotel for Google IO, so I'm making the commute back and forth each day, and it is killing me, not being with my team at all times. Just wanted to share that in this journal, in case there are other parents out there, feeling this same way.

### Exluded group I'm thinking about

Today I'm thinking about web developers who happen to be moms, and what that life is like around web developer event schedules.

When we travel, we often leave home as late as we can, and return home as early as we possible. And we rely upon the time away from family to work longer hours to finish up projects that we can't seem to break the back on in the midst of event schedules.

When we are at home, and events are close by, it is harder for us to make a decision between booking a hotel, just a short drive from our homes, or battle it out-- the juggling between lives.

Events are such an important part of the web developer community.

I wonder if there's some small things we can do around events to include web developer parents who can't attend in person, but want to do more than just watch a live stream? Or maybe we could think about parents as part of planning/scheduling events.

There's this logical trend of booking great talks at start and end of day so that audiences come for the longest period of time-- this may not be the most inclusive thing, however, for working parents.

### Actions completed

* Published blog post: [Next challenge: building a more inclusive web developer community](https://medium.com/@mkearney/next-challenge-building-a-more-inclusive-web-developer-community-d1eb39868dcf).
* Started day one of 100-day challenge.

### Actions to follow up on

* Reminder to follow up with @RayanZahab the first female Google Developer Expert in MENA.
* Reminder to follow up with Code for Good on possible collaboration opportunity.

## Day 2 - Thursday, May 10, 2018

Today is the last day of Google IO 2018. Just had a wonderful lunch with the women of Google Dev Rel. And I'm tired now-- belly is full. This will be a shorter than usual journal log, as I need to get back to the sandbox. 

But tomorrow, I have the day to read and think about things-- and hope to make some genuine progress!

### Excluded group I'm thinking about

Today I'm thinking about native mobile developers (Android and iOS), who seem to be curious about the web this year. 

It might be of interest to think a bit about native developers, and how they might build simple, but good websites. Or maybe how to help them even migrate to a website. I haven't spent much time on this-- but I noticed at IO this year, there was some interest from the native developers to better understand PWAs.

This morning I worked in Office Hours, helping people improve their websites. One person I met had a website that was linking to cordova, and he was using a webview. I'd also like to better understand what developers are trying to do to get their sites to work x-platform.

### Actions completed today

* Google IO 2018 finishes up today!

### Actions to follow up on

* Talk to some Android Dev Rel peeps to find out more about the bridging between the native and web-- common patterns (and anti-patterns).
* Follow up with Lyla about code for good.
* Follow up with the internal book club that Addy Osmani told me about (at the very least, can increase my books-to-read list).

## Day 3 - Saturday, May 11, 2018

Yesterday was the day after IO, and I took a much needed break from the digital world. This morning, I woke up first thing, wanting to check if there's a way to convert a scratch game to any other output. 

### Bringing students to the web

I've been thinking awhile about wanting to bring students to the web. And there are many ways to do that, especially with the simple Glitch sites.

But when it comes to younger children, like Amelia, I get the sense that it would be much easier to go to where they are rather than trying to disrupt their learning and completely shift them to the web.

Ideally, I'd like to figure out a simple way to convert a scratch game to a website. It isn't straight forward-- at the moment, you can convert a game through tools to java executables, similar native apps for other platforms, and you can embed a Scratch game into a website, but there isn't a straightforward conversion... yet. 

The main goal isn't even to just bring kids from Scratch to the web, it might be to create a similar UI based coding project that does work on the web-- something in Glitch may be doable.

Ideally, you would want kids to see a natural path from the logic of early days programming to hosting on the web.

### Actions to follow up on

* Spend a short period of time exploring a similar Scratch like coding experience that can be converted to a website.
* Also research learning materials out there for students on the web-- are they simple enough? More geared toward high school students?
* Look into most popular curriculums for students.

## Day 4 - Monday, May 14, 2018

Today was a post-IO catch-up day, trying to figure out all the normal work/life stuff that I missed out on over the past busy couple of months.

### Group to bring to the web developer community

Today, I started to think about the possibilities of targeting people who have Chromebooks. Up until now, development has been somewhat limited in terms of requiring access to certain kinds of hardware.

But now, with development possible on Chromebooks, we should be targeting how to make this as easy as possible to audiences who may not have realized development is now accessible to them.

### Actions to follow up on

* Checkout Chromebook OKRs, especially around distribution and education.
* More specifically, check if there's already plans to encourage development on Chromebooks, and then determine if we can help with these plans.
* Need to draft my doc plans in a more real way-- following 'Measure what matters', with three or four stretch objectives, and measurable key results. Use these notes to help make that happen this week!

### Actions completed today

* A little bit of dialog with Code for Good. Baby steps!

## Day 5 - Wednesday, May 16, 2018

Yesterday, I talked with some of my team members, one of whom mentioned a new intern we have joining us this summer who is very passionate about finding ways to help people in lower income areas realize and have access to the potential of learning to code. There's an intimidation factor that many people feel-- that unless they are already in the coding profession, or unless they are some stand-out math expert, there isn't a job that they can successfully do in the tech industry.

This is one of those myths we need to work hard to push against.

### Group to bring to the web developer community

There are many people in low income, rural areas, who don't necessarily see or understand the possibilities of coding as a way to make a living. There's all kinds of myths around being a coder that intimidates and alienates people. We need to change that!

The web developer community is perfect for people getting into coding. So we should make this happen.

### Actions completed today

* Finished reading Measure what matters (and got a great way to word the vision I'm having around my next big project!).

### Actions to follow up on

* Investigate efforts happening in Google for jobs to help people in low-income rural areas see the potential in learning to code. 
* Find out if web development is part of this narrative.

## Day 6 - Thursday, May 17, 2018
Today was a very busy day, and I'm about to stop to feed and bathe the kids.

But before I do, I wanted to capture some thoughts from yesterday.

Yesterday, I hosted students from the BlendEd program-- a mix of students across the Bay area who completed a cross-school entrepreneurial program. They had to present their product pitches. Lots of ideas came out of it.

I also had a strategic meeting to start to think about the next thing we build on my team-- and two ideas came out of it relating to this project that I want to create.

### Group to bring to the web developer community

There is an absolute opportunity to bring high school students like the ones in the BlendEd program (and others) to the web. These kids build product presentations, and every one of them said.... 'I don't have coding skills, but if I did...' Also, a few built 'engineering budgets' into their plans. 

And the kicker-- most of their products were interesting, and would be easy enough to build into a simple web app. We should give people like this more tools to see their ideas to fruition-- there is clearly this sort of notion that it is too hard to learn, so no point in trying.

I had many conversations with the students, as well, about kids in their schools who would probably work in Google-- and they fit the stereotype, loner, anti-social, super good at computers characteristics. And yet, the product ideas were very good-- closely related to their worlds-- if they realized how easy it would be to build something that would help people like them, we'd have a much more diverse set of ideas-- and that's just a small set of high school students!

### Actions completed

* Created a connection with a couple of teachers running programs across high schools in the Bay Area. They want to work together on a possible Bay Area wide, build for the web, project for next year-- very cool.
* Had some good ideas today in a meeting on inclusive metrics. For example, what if we tried to incentivise and target specific exclusive groups to contribute to our content, and then raise awareness and props when they do? That would be awesome. Don't lose site of this.
* Had a great discussion with a designer on the bus ride home about how to push forward on new projects when there isn't quite consensus. Listing the ideas in the actions to follow up on!
* Started reading The Culture Code.

### Actions to follow up on

* Create a calendar reminder to follow up with BlendEd leads on future collaboration.
* She (Noreen) suggested to create a weekly retro report which tracks decisions made, risks involves, and any concerns raised, or decisions decided against. This way everyone still gets a voice.
* Noreen also suggested to create strict planning docs, with 'fail fast' built in-- everyone lets experiments happen and are OK with it, because each week, risks are assessed, and when they get too high, then we fail fast.
* Noreen also suggested to hold weely 'keep stop start' meetings.
* Take notes on Measure What Matters! Main thing I want to capture is P. 216: Catalysts and Nourishers.

## Day 7 - Friday, May 18, 2018

Today I'm a bit down. (As I progress with this journal-- it is starting to feel like a journal!)

Why am I down? It's been a challenging week, some highs, some lows, and lots of worries. My daughter tried out for competetive soccer for the first time and I am genuinely surprised at how hard this has been-- the nerves seeing her be vulnerable and push herself, the worry if she will make a good team, then the decisions on what team to pick, and the back and forth with my husband trying to come to some sort of middle ground on how we see the world. 

We've picked a team-- and can honestly say now I just hope it is a good experience for her. I worry that I pushed for the wrong thing.

I'm also down because I'm trying to kick-start a very big project. I've been putting my heart into it-- and I see a good path to move forward, but I need to be better at building consensus and shifting into coding/building/creating mode. I'm disappointed in myself for not being more successful this week.

And finally, I have so many wonderful people I've met who I want to help-- but I can't seem to find the time that is needed to make things happen. I also get discouraged sometimes-- as I try and figure out this path-- there is a mixture of apathy and conflict that is a constant. It's exhausting. But I'm gonna keep at it... keep committed, and know that some days will be harder than others.

### Groups to raise up in the web developer community

Today I'm thinking about members of the web developer community who have been fighting the good fight for a long time now-- trying to build a more inclusive community.

There has to be some way to provide them more support, recognition, and a platform to help them scale. For sure, this will be a key, strategic part of building an inclusive web-- help leaders in the community who are actively building a more inclusive community to intersect and scale.

### Actions to follow up on

* Research/create list of at least 100 groups across the world who are actively trying to build a more inclusive web developer community.
* Help write, publish, and promote blog post on Rayan Zahab's journey. And follow up with her, Natalie, and Salim on how we can coordinate more.

### Actions completed today

* I feel it is worth recognizing that I went for a short run today. I was feeling down, and under-motivated, and I got myself out for a jog and feel better for it. Some days, just doing that is worth recognizing.

## Day 8 - Monday, May 21, 2018

Today I started off anxious, as I was away most of the weekend, and couldn't stay connected to work. And work is picking up! I had a great chat with a co-worker, a wonderful coaching session, and a power session building an action plan and underlying projects with a mentor and friend.

I'm finishing the day feeling grateful for the opportunities and the support that I have on any given day.

### Groups I'm thinking of in web developer community

I'm still thinking about people and groups who are working hard to create a better web developer community. They are setting the tone for a different kind of way of interacting with each other. And I want to be able to give them the support, voice, and platform to succeed.

I'm also thinking about how some of these groups might perceive any help that I try and give-- I do not want to come off as condescending in anyway. In all these instances-- these groups and people are better than me, more successful than me, well ahead of the game than most.

But I do work for a big corporation that might help these people and groups scale. So I'm thinking deeply about how to help people succeed without coming off in a weird way.

I'm thinking a bit more deeply about these groups and how I interact with them. I'm going to work hard to keep humble, listen, ask questions, and be thankful and gracious for whatever interaction and collaboration comes my way-- even when there's constructive critiques on how to be better.

### Actions completed today

* Read (and enjoyed) this blog today: https://code.likeagirl.io/understanding-the-journey-b6956ff745a0.
* Learned about the important balance between advocacy and inquiry. One has to be able to be both gracefully. Yes, have ideas and a way to action them that you are ready to advocate for-- but also listen to people and their ideas and their reaction to your ideas. 
* Also learned about the importance of remembering to think about failure at the start of projects-- what would happen if you failed, what might cause the failures, and how can you mitigate those risks. We think about this in technical situations-- but it's also very useful to think about this in terms of relationships! I need to get better at this.

### Actions to follow up on

* Make more progressive in The coding culture (fell behind this weekend as I was away with kids).
* Come up with a way to discover companies that are actively building inclusion into their product, and are having measured success.
* Build 'what if this fails' into inclusive-web-project. And then mitigate the risks.
* Also create a 'what success looks like' into inclusive-web-project.

## Day 9 - Tuesday, May 21, 2018

Today, I got to attend this awesome training program to coach me to be better in strategic conversations. We videotaped ourselves, got peer reviewed and then repeated the pattern. Also did live version with wider audience. Great experience. I'm gonna use this approach all the time, so thought it worth sharing!

### Group I'm thinking about today

Interestingly enough, I'm thinking about web developers using search engines to find answers, and how strategic the platform positioning is when it comes to those results. I realize that's a good thing-- that popular platforms will get most of the traffic, under the presumption that the platform is popular because it's good.

But I also wonder if maybe we've created a sort of chicken-egg scenario. If a developer asks a question, and there's only one top search result that seems to directly answer that question, that of course, developers will go to that platform to get the answer. 

In many instances, that might be good-- but in the instance of feeling included and welcome-- it might not always be the case.

I'm also thinking deeply about how search engines are getting much more intelligent about providing answers in the search results. And while that's happening for many different user types, I wish it was happening more for developers.

For example, if I search for how to authenticate users on website, the search results I'm getting are fairly far off from what I want. There's an opportunity here that we are missing out on!

### Actions completed

* Read this interesting blog post, took the test, and added a comment: https://code.likeagirl.io/take-the-tech-privilege-walk-19409e4c0053
* Also emailed the team to see if there's any happenings around building a website to let people take this test online, and to track some interesting metrics around it.
* Signed up to dev.to and posted an invite to help on this project. 

### Actions to follow up on

* Would love to create the website around the tech privilege walk, and expose the metrics on the site for people who've taken the test. Also would like to get a sense of demographics too, and compare to results. For example, my score seemed quite low for someone like me with so much privilege (-3).
* Follow up on dev.to posting: https://dev.to/meggin/lets-build-a-more-inclusive-web-developer-community-4f6o.

## Day 10 - Thursday, May 24, 2018
Today is the first 10th day. Woot! It took me 15 days to get to 10 days. I plan to write a blog post to capture some key learnings, and to create a list of the best actions that I think might be useful to work on.

### Group I'm thinking about today
Interestingly enough, today I'm thinking about some of the developers I work with who one would assume are the main-stream, included group. These are mainly white men with computer science degrees from reputable universities who've worked on hard projects and succeeded. Many of these men are married with children, and most of their wives do not work.

I am often amazed at the visible hours they put into their jobs. And I wonder about that-- about whether or not I can ever be as successful as any of these men, given that I need to be with my children in the morning, getting them ready for school, and I need to be with my children in the evening, when we have dinner, do homework, play games, snuggle.

It is a strange thing to think about, and honestly, I'm uncomfortable. But I do believe that as I'm thinking of all the groups that may be excluded-- I should also keep my unconscious bias and deeper darker thoughts in check. I do need to think about who exactly I presume to be in the included group-- and what that inclusion looks like.

Because here's the reality-- we are only going to build a more inclusive web, if that is to the benefit of everyone.

### Actions completed
* Completed first 10 days!

### Actions to follow up on
* Write the blog post!
