# Inclusive Web Project Journal - First 10 Days

## Day 1 - Wednesday, May 9, 2018

Today is the first day of my 100-day challenge to think about how to build a more inclusive web. At the moment, I'm sitting on a shuttle bus heading down to Mountain View for the second day of Google IO 2018.

My primary feeling this morning, is one I'm quite familiar with -- that push and pull between the work that I love doing, and the family that I'm responsible for.

I didn't book a hotel for Google IO, so I'm making the commute back and forth each day, and it is killing me, not being with my team at all times. Just wanted to share that in this journal, in case there are other parents out there, feeling this same way.

### Exluded group I'm thinking about

Today I'm thinking about web developers who happen to be moms, and what that life is like around web developer event schedules.

When we travel, we often leave home as late as we can, and return home as early as we possible. And we rely upon the time away from family to work longer hours to finish up projects that we can't seem to break the back on in the midst of event schedules.

When we are at home, and events are close by, it is harder for us to make a decision between booking a hotel, just a short drive from our homes, or battle it out-- the juggling between lives.

Events are such an important part of the web developer community.

I wonder if there's some small things we can do around events to include web developer parents who can't attend in person, but want to do more than just watch a live stream? Or maybe we could think about parents as part of planning/scheduling events.

There's this logical trend of booking great talks at start and end of day so that audiences come for the longest period of time-- this may not be the most inclusive thing, however, for working parents.

## Day 2 - Thursday, May 10, 2018

Today is the last day of Google IO 2018. Just had a wonderful lunch with the women of Google Dev Rel. And I'm tired now-- belly is full. This will be a shorter than usual journal log, as I need to get back to the sandbox. 

But tomorrow, I have the day to read and think about things-- and hope to make some genuine progress!

### Excluded group I'm thinking about

Today I'm thinking about native mobile developers (Android and iOS), who seem to be curious about the web this year. 

It might be of interest to think a bit about native developers, and how they might build simple, but good websites. Or maybe how to help them even migrate to a website. I haven't spent much time on this-- but I noticed at IO this year, there was some interest from the native developers to better understand PWAs.

This morning I worked in Office Hours, helping people improve their websites. One person I met had a website that was linking to cordova, and he was using a webview. I'd also like to better understand what developers are trying to do to get their sites to work x-platform.

### Actions completed today

* Google IO 2018 finishes up today!

### Actions to follow up on

* Talk to some Android Dev Rel peeps to find out more about the bridging between the native and web-- common patterns (and anti-patterns).
* Follow up with Lyla about code for good.
* Follow up with the internal book club that Addy Osmani told me about (at the very least, can increase my books-to-read list).
