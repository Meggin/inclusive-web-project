# Inclusive Web Project Journal - First 10 Days

## Day 1 - Wednesday, May 9, 2018

Today is the first day of my 100-day challenge to think about how to build a more inclusive web. At the moment, I'm sitting on a shuttle bus heading down to Mountain View for the second day of Google IO 2018.

My primary feeling this morning, is one I'm quite familiar with -- that push and pull between the work that I love doing, and the family that I'm responsible for.

I didn't book a hotel for Google IO, so I'm making the commute back and forth each day, and it is killing me, not being with my team at all times. Just wanted to share that in this journal, in case there are other parents out there, feeling this same way.

### Exluded group I'm thinking about

Today I'm thinking about web developers who happen to be moms, and what that life is like around web developer event schedules.

When we travel, we often leave home as late as we can, and return home as early as we possible. And we rely upon the time away from family to work longer hours to finish up projects that we can't seem to break the back on in the midst of event schedules.

When we are at home, and events are close by, it is harder for us to make a decision between booking a hotel, just a short drive from our homes, or battle it out-- the juggling between lives.

Events are such an important part of the web developer community.

I wonder if there's some small things we can do around events to include web developer parents who can't attend in person, but want to do more than just watch a live stream? Or maybe we could think about parents as part of planning/scheduling events.

There's this logical trend of booking great talks at start and end of day so that audiences come for the longest period of time-- this may not be the most inclusive thing, however, for working parents.

### Actions completed

* Reminder to follow up with Code for Good on possible collaboration opportunity.

## Day 2 - Thursday, May 10, 2018

Today is the last day of Google IO 2018. Just had a wonderful lunch with the women of Google Dev Rel. And I'm tired now-- belly is full. This will be a shorter than usual journal log, as I need to get back to the sandbox. 

But tomorrow, I have the day to read and think about things-- and hope to make some genuine progress!

### Excluded group I'm thinking about

Today I'm thinking about native mobile developers (Android and iOS), who seem to be curious about the web this year. 

It might be of interest to think a bit about native developers, and how they might build simple, but good websites. Or maybe how to help them even migrate to a website. I haven't spent much time on this-- but I noticed at IO this year, there was some interest from the native developers to better understand PWAs.

This morning I worked in Office Hours, helping people improve their websites. One person I met had a website that was linking to cordova, and he was using a webview. I'd also like to better understand what developers are trying to do to get their sites to work x-platform.

### Actions completed today

* Google IO 2018 finishes up today!

### Actions to follow up on

* Talk to some Android Dev Rel peeps to find out more about the bridging between the native and web-- common patterns (and anti-patterns).
* Follow up with Lyla about code for good.
* Follow up with the internal book club that Addy Osmani told me about (at the very least, can increase my books-to-read list).

## Day 3 - Saturday, May 11, 2018

Yesterday was the day after IO, and I took a much needed break from the digital world. This morning, I woke up first thing, wanting to check if there's a way to convert a scratch game to any other output. 

### Bringing students to the web

I've been thinking awhile about wanting to bring students to the web. And there are many ways to do that, especially with the simple Glitch sites.

But when it comes to younger children, like Amelia, I get the sense that it would be much easier to go to where they are rather than trying to disrupt their learning and completely shift them to the web.

Ideally, I'd like to figure out a simple way to convert a scratch game to a website. It isn't straight forward-- at the moment, you can convert a game through tools to java executables, similar native apps for other platforms, and you can embed a Scratch game into a website, but there isn't a straightforward conversion... yet. 

The main goal isn't even to just bring kids from Scratch to the web, it might be to create a similar UI based coding project that does work on the web-- something in Glitch may be doable.

Ideally, you would want kids to see a natural path from the logic of early days programming to hosting on the web.

### Actions to follow up on

* Spend a short period of time exploring a similar Scratch like coding experience that can be converted to a website.
* Also research learning materials out there for students on the web-- are they simple enough? More geared toward high school students?
* Look into most popular curriculums for students.

## Day 4 - Monday, May 14, 2018

Today was a post-IO catch-up day, trying to figure out all the normal work/life stuff that I missed out on over the past busy couple of months.

### Group to bring to the web developer community

Today, I started to think about the possibilities of targeting people who have Chromebooks. Up until now, development has been somewhat limited in terms of requiring access to certain kinds of hardware.

But now, with development possible on Chromebooks, we should be targeting how to make this as easy as possible to audiences who may not have realized development is now accessible to them.

### Actions to follow up on

* Checkout Chromebook OKRs, especially around distribution and education.
* More specifically, check if there's already plans to encourage development on Chromebooks, and then determine if we can help with these plans.
* Need to draft my doc plans in a more real way-- following 'Measure what matters', with three or four stretch objectives, and measurable key results. Use these notes to help make that happen this week!

### Actions completed today

* A little bit of dialog with Code for Good. Baby steps!

## Day 5 - Wednesday, May 16, 2018

Yesterday, I talked with some of my team members, one of whom mentioned a new intern we have joining us this summer who is very passionate about finding ways to help people in lower income areas realize and have access to the potential of learning to code. There's an intimidation factor that many people feel-- that unless they are already in the coding profession, or unless they are some stand-out math expert, there isn't a job that they can successfully do in the tech industry.

This is one of those myths we need to work hard to push against.

### Group to bring to the web developer community

There are many people in low income, rural areas, who don't necessarily see or understand the possibilities of coding as a way to make a living. There's all kinds of myths around being a coder that intimidates and alienates people. We need to change that!

The web developer community is perfect for people getting into coding. So we should make this happen.

### Actions completed today

* Finished reading Measure what matters (and got a great way to word the vision I'm having around my next big project!).

### Actions to follow up on

* Investigate efforts happening in Google for jobs to help people in low-income rural areas see the potential in learning to code. 
* Find out if web development is part of this narrative.
