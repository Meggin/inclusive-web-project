# Inclusive Web Project Journal - Second 10 Days
I've hit my first stumbling block in this project-- I'm in a deadline, working long hours, and it is tough to work on anything other than that deadline (aside from time spent with kids).

As a result, I missed a week of contributions, and have yet to write the blog post for the first 10 days.

I can say this-- having this project on my mind is influencing lots of other projects, including the deadline. And hopefully I'll have a chance to connect the dots between projects in the near future.

## Day 11 - Wednesday, May 30, 2018

I'm typing this on a bus, that is currently very bumpy. But I did not want to miss another day. And then I'm home with the kids, getting them to bed, and back to work on my deadline. So this is as good as it gets.

### Group I'm thinking about today

Today I'm thinking about people who want to learn to code, but who think their lives are so busy and the task is so hard, that is nearly impossible for them to make any progress.

I've always loved the balance between setting big goals, but then progressing through completing small tasks each day-- eventually building up something amazing over time. 

It is the foundation of marathon training-- one mile at a time. And I try and live my life this way.

What if we could create a path for people who only have a very small bit of time each day to progress toward something meaningful in their coding journey?

### Actions completed

* Created the second 10 days journal entry.
* Started [The Progress Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Progress-Principle-Ignite-Engagement-Creativity/dp/142219857X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527726346&sr=8-1&keywords=the+progress+principle).

### Actions to follow up on

* Try and carve out time for even just a short blog post! It's hard, I realize, but it would be a good thing to do.

## Day 12 - Friday, June 8. 2018

I set a mini-deadline for myself in work with another peer-- we've been experimenting with new ways to grow our web developer community, and help that community succeed. It's been a cool couple of weeks and I hope to have more to share about that soon.

Part of this exploration has been thinking about ways to help scale the work of awesome people and companies in our community. It's kind of an interesting problem-- you want to be the catalyst to help others succeed, matching your success to their success. 

We aren't there yet, but we've made some baby steps and will write more about this once things solidify a bit. At the very least, it might explain why I've been a little slower on this journal.

### Group I'm thinking about today

I've been thinking a lot about many different people I've been reading about in the tech community and who've I've been following, people who are trying very actively to build more inclusive communities. People like Ellen Pao, Eryka Joy, April Wensel, Jenn Schiffer, Susan Fowler, Tracy Lee, Natalie Villaboos, Rayan Zahab.

It's only been a month since I started this journal, and already work and life stuff has come up. It's been hard to stay diligent. Also, I've tried to discuss some of my ideas, I've started to ask questions around this topic in parts of my day job, and I'm starting to realize that it takes quite a bit to not get discouraged and keep on taking those baby steps forward.

I have such a new found respect for these women who are able to gather momentum and start to have some impact, some cultural significance in shifting the way we think about how tech should be in the future. Wow. Props to these women.

### Actions completed

* A friend shared this with me, and I quite like it, so sharing with you: [Give it five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes)

### Actions to follow up on

* Finish applying for cool inclusive coding project so we can buid a bit more momentum around this project!

## Day 12 - Friday, July 27. 2018

Tonight I am speaking at Code4Good and kick-starting the first proper project as part of the larger inclusive web project-- building inclusive developer surveys. Very excited!

### Actions completed

* Finished applying for Code4Good and presenting tonight!
* Got slide-deck and repo ready for presentation.

### Actions to follow up on

* Will spend the next week participating in Code4Good, pushing toward the early stages of building an inclusive developer survey platform.
