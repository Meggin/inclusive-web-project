# Inclusive Web Project Journal - Second 10 Days
I've hit my first stumbling block in this project-- I'm in a deadline, working long hours, and it is tough to work on anything other than that deadline (aside from time spent with kids).

As a result, I missed a week of contributions, and have yet to write the blog post for the first 10 days.

I can say this-- having this project on my mind is influencing lots of other projects, including the deadline. And hopefully I'll have a chance to connect the dots between projects in the near future.

## Day 11 - Wednesday, May 30, 2018

I'm typing this on a bus, that is currently very bumpy. But I did not want to miss another day. And then I'm home with the kids, getting them to bed, and back to work on my deadline. So this is as good as it gets.

### Group I'm thinking about today

Today I'm thinking about people who want to learn to code, but who think their lives are so busy and the task is so hard, that is nearly impossible for them to make any progress.

I've always loved the balance between setting big goals, but then progressing through completing small tasks each day-- eventually building up something amazing over time. 

It is the foundation of marathon training-- one mile at a time. And I try and live my life this way.

What if we could create a path for people who only have a very small bit of time each day to progress toward something meaningful in their coding journey?

### Actions completed

* Created the second 10 days journal entry.
* Started [The Progress Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Progress-Principle-Ignite-Engagement-Creativity/dp/142219857X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527726346&sr=8-1&keywords=the+progress+principle).

### Actions to follow up on

* Try and carve out time for even just a short blog post! It's hard, I realize, but it would be a good thing to do.
