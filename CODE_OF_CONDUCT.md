## The Quick Version

We are dedicated to building a more inclusive web, and that means providing a harassment-free environment for everyone to participate, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any project work. Anyone violating these rules will lose their privilege to contribute.

## The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please raise an issue.
