# inclusive-web-project
Exploring ways to make the web developer community more inclusive.

## Starting point - 100-day journal
To kick-start this project, I will keep a 100-day journal. I'll keep track of people I talk to, research I complete, information I gain out of this research, and any action items that come out of the work.

## Reading log
To learn more about the industry (and hopefully discover ways to change it), I'm gonna read a lot of books, and keep a reading journal.

I'll also include anything I watch or listen to that might be of interest.

## Contribute!

I would absolutely love all the help I can get in trying to figure out effective ways to build a more inclusive web developer community.

Please raise issues with any ideas you might have: [https://github.com/Meggin/inclusive-web-project/issues](https://github.com/Meggin/inclusive-web-project/issues).

You can also submit pull requests with your own journal entries and reading logs!
