# inclusive-web-project

Welcome to the inclusive web project!

We've got an ambitious goal to create a more inclusive web developer community.

In our first project, we will create a new type of developer survey,
one that is intentionally inclusive. 

We will build a website to host our survey, as well as track responses.

Once we get the basics in place,
we will create a widget that other sites can use to embed the survey in their sites.

As more partners share the survey with their developers,
we hope to gather data about our developers in an open, inclusive way.

## Contribute!

We would love for you to help us get started on building a new inclusive survey platform.

We've got our high level tasks scoped out in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Meggin/inclusive-web-project/issues),
which we will continue to build into a better project plan.

If you would like to contribute,
please read our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
