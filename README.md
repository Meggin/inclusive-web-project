# inclusive-web-project

Welcome to the inclusive web project!

We've got an ambitious goal to create a more inclusive web developer community.

Our first project is to create a new type of developer survey that is intentionally inclusive.

We will build a website to host our survey, as well as track responses.

As we progress, we will create a widget that other sites can use to embed the survey in their sites.

## Contribute!

We would love for you to help us get started on building a new inclusive survey platform.

We've got our high level tasks scoped out in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Meggin/inclusive-web-project/issues),
which we will soon build into a proper project plan.

If you would like to contribute,
please read our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
