# inclusive-web-project
Exploring ways to make the web developer community more inclusive.

For now I'm in explorer mode, but as the project takes shape, I'll use GitHub's milestone tracking to create a plan, and action that plan.

## Starting point - 100-day journal
To kick-start this project, I'm keeping a 100-day journal. I'll keep track of people I talk to, research I complete, information I gain out of this research, and any action items that come out of the work.

Check it out: 
* [First 10 days](https://github.com/Meggin/inclusive-web-project/blob/master/journal/first-10-days.md).
* [Second 10 days](https://github.com/Meggin/inclusive-web-project/blob/master/journal/second-10-days.md).

## Reading log
To learn more about the industry (and hopefully discover ways to change it), I'm gonna read a lot of books, and keep a reading journal.

I'll also include anything I watch or listen to that might be of interest.

Check it out: [Reading log](https://github.com/Meggin/inclusive-web-project/blob/master/reading-log.md).

I would absolutely love all the help I can get in trying to figure out effective ways to build a more inclusive web developer community.
