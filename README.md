# inclusive-web-project
Exploring ways to make the web developer community more inclusive.

## Starting point - 100-day journal

To kick-start this project, I will keep a 100-day journal in which I will answer these four questions:

* Any new thoughts on what the inclusive web might look like?
* Any new ideas on how to build a more inclusive web?
* Did I plan or complete any actions toward building a more inclusive web?
* Did I have any interesting conversations or read something that might help me better understand how to build a more inclusive web?

## Reading log
To learn more about the industry (and hopefully discover ways to change it), I'm gonna read a lot of books, and keep a reading journal.

## Contribute!

I would absolutely love all the help I can get in trying to figure out effective ways to build a more inclusive web developer community.

Please raise issues with any ideas you might have: [https://github.com/Meggin/inclusive-web-project/issues](https://github.com/Meggin/inclusive-web-project/issues).

You can also submit pull requests with your own journal entries and reading logs!
