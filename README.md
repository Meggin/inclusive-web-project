# inclusive-web-project
Exploring ways to make the web developer community more inclusive.

## Starting point

To kick-start this project, I will keep a 100-day journal in which I will answer these four questions:

* Any new thoughts on what the inclusive web might look like?
* Any new ideas on how to build a more inclusive web?
* Did I plan or complete any actions toward building a more inclusive web?
* Did I have any interesting conversations or read something that might help me better understand how to build a more inclusive web?

I will also keep a reading log for the books I read each week.

## Contribute!

I would absolutely love all the help I can get in trying to figure out effective ways to build a more inclusive web developer community.

Please raise issues with any ideas you might have.

You can also submit pull requests with your own journal entries!
